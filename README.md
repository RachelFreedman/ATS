# Active Teacher Selection (ATS) experiments

This codebase implements a hidden-utility-bandit problem as a POMDP, then benchmarks the performance of ATS and several other algorithms. Use the julia scripts in the `run_scripts` directory to run experiments, and use the juypter notebooks in the `make_plots` directory to analyze the results.
