# Active Teacher Selection (ATS) experiments

This codebase implements a hidden-utility-bandit (HUB) problem as a POMDP, then benchmarks the performance of active teacher selection (ATS) and several other algorithms. See the `experiment_scripts` directory for algorithmic implementation.

Use the julia scripts in the `run_scripts` directory to run experiments. For example:

```
julia run_scripts/run_all.sh
```
